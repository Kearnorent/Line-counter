This is a line counter!

This program usually takes two arguments:
The first is a string either representing literally a string OR a path to an input file
Both these inputs represent a list of file extensions acting as
patterns usually like this: "cc,hh,json,txt"

The second argument is a path to the directory that we will search through

This program counts the total number of lines of all the matching files
(depending on the extensions) in the given directory and its sub-directories

Example of use: ./cl [string_input] [directory_path]
OR ./cl [input_file_path] [directory_path]

Example of input file: file containing: "json, cc, c, hh, txt, h"

(./cl "cc" ".", or: " ./cl file.in "./src")
